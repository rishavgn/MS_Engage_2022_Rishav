   #### Using pearson corrleation
       The Pearson correlation method that assigns -1/0/1 values, where 0 has no correlation, 1 has total
       positive correlation and -1 has total negative correlation.This is interpreted as follows: a correlation
       value of 0.7 between two variables would indicate that a significant and positive relationship 
       exists between the two. A positive correlation signifies that if variable A goes up, then B 
       will also go up, whereas if the value of the correlation is negative, then if A increases, B
       decreases.
